# QMK Configurations

So, sometimes I have mech keyboard-related ideas, and other times I break my own keyboards.  
These are my ideas and my damage control plans.

### Hakase
IoT macro pad. Thought that internet-connected lightbulbs were a bad idea? Well I internet-connected a keyboard.  
Basically a normal macro pad that can interface with your smart home.  
**AT THE TIME OF WRITING, THE STM32 LOW DENSITY VERSION DOESN'T COMPILE ON UPSTREAM QMK DUE TO BUGS, AND ANY OTHER VERSION DOESN'T TOO DUE TO A TYPO IN THE QMK SOURCE CODE (LMAO). USE MY FORK FOR NOW.**
